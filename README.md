---

## ‚úÖ Tasks 

### 1. Variable and Data Types
- Created 5 variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Demonstrated usage of: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Undefined`, `Null`.
- Used `typeof` to log data types in the console.

### 2. Hoisting Demo
- Showcased hoisting behavior of `var` and `let` through examples.
- Included comments explaining the result of `console.log` before declaration.

### 3. User Greeting (Using Conditionals)
- Collected user input with `prompt()`.
- Displayed alerts based on age categories:
  - Teen
  - Adult
  - Senior Citizen

### 4. Looping Numbers
- `for` loop: printed numbers from 1 to 10.
- `while` loop: printed even numbers from 2 to 20.
- `do...while` loop: counted down from 10 to 1.

### 5. Functions
- Regular function: `add(a, b)` to return sum.
- Function expression: returned the square of a number.
- Arrow function: greeted user with their name.
- Logged all results using `console.log()`.

### 6. Callback Practice
- Created `processNumber(num, callback)` function.
- Passed anonymous function to double the number and log it.

## üèÅ Mini Project - Web Calculator

Created a simple calculator using `prompt()` and `alert()`:
- Performs **Add**, **Subtract**, **Multiply**, **Divide**.
- Takes input from user interactively.
- Displays results using alert messages.
